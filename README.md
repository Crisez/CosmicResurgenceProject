# Cosmic Resurgence Project
Game Programming Project

This solo project was meant to focus on state machines and coroutines. I also worked with the idea of creating an upgrade system for the player. The general premise of the prototype was that you were playing as a creature on a planet that was being taken over by humans, and that you needed to fight and adapt to survive.
